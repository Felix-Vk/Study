# Global Systems Engineer Bootcamp — 3 Month Detailed Guide

**Goal:** Become a systems / OS / low-level engineer capable of building kernels, low-latency systems and high-performance C++ code.  
**No installs required** — everything in this guide uses browser-based tools (Replit, Codespaces, copy.sh/v86, OnlineGDB, OS Virtual Labs).

### 🔹 Month 1 — Modern C++ & OS Basics
- Week 1: Pointers, RAII, smart pointers → Project: Smart_Pointer  
- Week 2: STL & multithreading → Project: Multithreaded_Logger  
- Week 3: fork/exec, processes → Project: Mini_Shell  
- Week 4: Scheduling algorithms → Project: CPU_Scheduler_Simulation  

### 🔹 Month 2 — Bootloader, Kernel Concepts, Virtual FS
- Week 5: Write “Hello” bootloader (Assembly) → Project: Bootloader_Assembly  
- Week 6–7: Protected mode, interrupts, context switching → Project: Kernel_Simulation  
- Week 8: Virtual File System (create/read/write) → Project: Virtual_File_System  

### 🔹 Month 3 — Performance, Networking, Final Project
- Week 9: Profiling and optimization → Project: Function_Profiler  
- Week 10: TCP echo server (sockets) → Project: TCP_Echo_Server  
- Week 11–12: Trading Engine Simulator (multi-threaded) → Project: Trading_Engine_Simulator
